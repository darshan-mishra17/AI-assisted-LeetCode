# 🚨 CORS FIX FOR RENDER DEPLOYMENT

## 🔍 Issue Analysis:
From your screenshots, I can see:
1. ✅ Backend is deployed and running at `https://ai-assisted-leetcode.onrender.com`
2. ❌ Frontend getting CORS errors when trying to connect
3. 🔍 The frontend URL shows `ai-assisted-leet-code.vercel.app` (with dashes)
4. 🔍 But error shows it's trying to connect to `ai-assisted-leetcode.onrender.com`

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS:

### Step 1: Update CORS in Render Environment Variables
Go to your Render dashboard > Environment tab and update:

```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://ai-assisted-leet-code.vercel.app,https://ai-assisted-leetcode.vercel.app,https://localhost:5173,*
```

### Step 2: Add Wildcard CORS (Temporary Fix)
Add this additional environment variable:

```
CORS_ALLOW_ALL=true
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend API URL
In your Vercel deployment, set the environment variable:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://ai-assisted-leetcode.onrender.com
```

## 🔧 Alternative: Update Backend CORS Code
If environment variables don't work, you can update your main.py CORS to:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins for now
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH", "OPTIONS"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## ⚡ Quick Test:
1. After updating environment variables in Render, wait 1-2 minutes for restart
2. Test CORS: `https://ai-assisted-leetcode.onrender.com/cors-test`
3. Test frontend signup/login
4. Check browser console for CORS errors

## 🎯 Root Cause:
The main issue is that your frontend URL in browser shows `ai-assisted-leet-code.vercel.app` but the CORS might be configured for a slightly different URL format.

## ✅ Final Solution:
Update the ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable in Render with the corrected URLs above, and your CORS issues should be resolved!
