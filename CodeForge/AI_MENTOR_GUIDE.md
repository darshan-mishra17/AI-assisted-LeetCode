- Provides context-aware recommendations

### Adaptive Learning
- Tracks your progress over time
- Identifies patterns in your coding style
- Adjusts difficulty and explanation level
- Provides increasingly personalized assistance

## üåü Best Practices

### For Students
1. **Start Simple**: Ask for hints before diving into complex explanations
2. **Be Specific**: Provide context about what you're struggling with
3. **Use Iteratively**: Have conversations, don't just ask one question
4. **Practice Regularly**: Use the learning paths for structured improvement

### For Educators
1. **Review AI Suggestions**: AI mentor complements but doesn't replace teaching
2. **Encourage Questions**: Students should ask follow-up questions
3. **Monitor Progress**: Use AI insights to identify common student issues
4. **Customize Difficulty**: Adjust AI responses based on class level

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "AI Mentor not responding"
- Check if GROQ_API_KEY is set in .env
- Verify internet connection
- Check backend logs for errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

#### "Fallback responses only"
- GROQ_API_KEY may be invalid or missing
- Check API key permissions and limits
- Verify environment variables are loaded

#### "Vector database errors"
- Ensure chroma_db directory exists
- Check file permissions
- Clear vector database if corrupted: `rm -rf chroma_db && mkdir chroma_db`

#### "Dependencies not found"
- Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.8+ required)
- Verify virtual environment is activated

### Performance Optimization

1. **Response Time**: First request may be slower (model loading)
2. **Memory Usage**: Vector database grows over time - monitor disk space
3. **API Limits**: Groq has rate limits - implement backoff if needed
4. **Caching**: Responses are not cached - consider implementing for frequent queries

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

### Health Checks
- `/api/ai/mentor-status` - Check system status
- Monitor response times and error rates
- Track API usage and limits

### Usage Analytics
- Conversation history stored in vector database
- Track user engagement and satisfaction
- Monitor most requested features and concepts

3. **Slack/Discord Bot**: Team coding assistance
4. **API Webhooks**: Integration with external tools

## üí° Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

### Writing Better Prompts
- **Be Specific**: "Help me optimize this sorting algorithm" vs "Help me"
- **Provide Context**: Include your current understanding and what you've tried
- **Ask Follow-ups**: Don't stop at the first response, dig deeper
- **Share Code**: Include relevant code snippets for better analysis

### Learning Strategies
1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with easier concepts, build up complexity
2. **Concept Connections**: Ask how concepts relate to each other
3. **Real-world Applications**: Understand practical uses of algorithms
4. **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key to improvement

### Debugging Effectively
1. **Isolate Issues**: Share the specific part of code that's problematic
2. **Include Error Messages**: Full error text helps AI understand the issue
3. **Describe Expected Behavior**: What should happen vs what is happening
4. **Test Incrementally**: Make small changes and test frequently
